                <p>Shure’s Music Phone Adapter (MPA) is our favorite iPhone solution, since it lets you use the
                    headphones you’re most comfortable with. It has an iPhone-compatible jack at one end and a
                    microphone module with an Answer/End/Pause button and a female 3.5mm audio jack for connecting to
                    your own headphones. We connected the adapter to the Shure SE110 in-ear headphones, whose cabling is
                    modular; the top half is fairly short, so when used with the adapter, the cable is the right length,
                    but the mic lays around your navel.</p>
                <p id="mgTop">The MPA comes with three different sizes of foam and silicone tips and a carrying pouch. Shure’s
                    coated memory-foam tips are the most comfortable on the market, and they stay in your ear
                    securely–especially if you wear the cables over the tops of your ears.</p>
